        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Makes about 3 dozen cookies.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                
                <li>1/2 tsp. baking soda</li>
                
                <li>2 sticks unsalted butter, softened (salted and it is fine if you don't have unsalted)</li>
                
                <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
                
                <li>1 cup packed brown sugar</li>
                
                <li>1 tsp. salt</li>
                
                <li>2 tsp. pure vanilla extract</li>
                
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
                
                <li>2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips (I always use Ghirardelli 60% Cacao, which makes them extra delicious)</li>
            </ul>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350.</li>

                <li>In a small bowl, whisk together the flour and baking soda; set aside.</li> 

                <li>In the bowl of an electric mixer with the paddle attachment, combine the butter and both sugars; mix on medium speed until pale and fluffy.</li>

                <li>Reduce speed to low; add the salt, vanilla and eggs. Mix well, about 1 minute.</li> 

                <li>Add flour mixture; mix until just combined.</li>

                <li>Stir in the chocolate chips.</li>

                <li>Drop heaping tablespoon-sized balls of dough about 2 inches apart on baking sheets lined with parchment paper (if you have it, or use nonstick spray).</li>

                <li>Bake until cookies are golden around the edges but still soft in the centers, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
                
                <li>Let cool on baking sheet 1 to 2 minutes, then take them off and let them cool completely.</li>
                
            </ol>
